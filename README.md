Student and Courses Manager App in Android Studio - Kotlin, ROOM

This app was delivered as the final project of the Mobile module of the Software Developer course at CESAE.

It was an excellent challenge but it is far from finish. My goal is to improve and update the app in the future.

The app was built in Android Studio using Kotlin language.

It uses some features like Google API, Weather API and auto-login (with tokens).

To ensure the best performance, we utilized Retrofit and Recycle Views.

The app is multilingual (Portuguese and English).

The user can sign up, and get has many registrations as he wants. It also have the possibility to recover the password.

As database we used ROOM.
